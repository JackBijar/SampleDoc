TreeSet :

Key points to note about TreeSet :

	TreeSet cannot contain duplicate elements.
	TreeSet cannot contain null value.
	TreeSet internally uses a TreeMap to store elements.
	TreeSet class is not thread-safe.
	
:	Hashtable vs HashMap										:
	
=>	Hashtable and HashMap both implements Map<K,V> interface and works on the Principle of Hashing.

	Synchronization/Thread Safe : Hashtable is synchronized and threadsafe, where as HashMap is non synchronized and not thread safe.

	Null/NonNull : Hashtable permits any number of null values and one null key.
	
	Performance : Hashmap is much faster and uses less memory than Hashtable.
	
	Iterations: Maps allows you to iterate and retrieve keys, values, and both key-value pairs as well, Where Hashtable donâ€™t have all this capability.
